## :rocket: Quick Start

These instructions will help you set up a deployment as fast as possible.
It is assumed that you have Node 16+ and pnpm installed.

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies.

2. Delete all images in `images` and replace with your own.

3. Edit the configuration in [`gallery.config.ts`](/gallery.config.ts)

4. Build Nuxt in static mode with `pnpm generate`.

5. Deploy the static build on hosting of your choosing. 
Netlify is used for the demo and they make it easy to deploy with their [CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) or alternatively,
there are Github Actions available to build & deploy to Netlify.
